## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My application will be used to manage shipping of cargoes from one city to another. It will manage the logistics of acquiring goods, assigning a specific load to a designated driver and confirmation of goods delivery. This idea was borne out of the desire to establish a shipping company.
At this stage, it is envisioned that the homepage of the application will have a general description of the services offered by the company. It will also allow employers to sign in/signup. Specific roles will be assigned during signup based on the employee’s job description. The app will be useful for drivers because they can login from home and view their daily task assignment.

### Features
Driver/Supervisor Signup: Users will sign up to the application using an HR generated token. Driver/Supervisor Sign In: Users will sign in using their credentials. Once signed in, they can view their daily assignments. Users will also be able to confirm that they have completed their assignment for the day.
Tracking: This feature will allow tracking of goods shipment. It will show the expected delivery time/date and possibly track the delivery truck on the map.
Assignment view: The drivers will be able to glance at who is assigned what route for the day. they can choose to swap with another driver if approved by a supervisor.
